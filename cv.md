###Briefly about myself
I have a bachelor's degree in Economics. I had an internship in sales departments in IB, was an oil trader,
worked as Deputy Head of Foreign Economic Activity, but my favorite job remains being a sales person 
in surf shop in small American town.
I like to learn something new, honest and responsible person.
